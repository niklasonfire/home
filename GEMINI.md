# Project: LVGL v9 Demo (ESP-IDF)

## Overview
This project is an embedded firmware application based on the **Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)**. It demonstrates the capabilities of the **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) version 9** running on an ESP32-based development board (specifically targeting the **ESP32-P4** and **Waveshare ESP32-P4 Nano** as seen in managed components).

The application initializes the display hardware using a Board Support Package (BSP) and runs a graphical benchmark demo.

## Architecture & Technologies
*   **Language:** C
*   **Framework:** ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
*   **Graphics Library:** LVGL v9.4.0
*   **Build System:** CMake
*   **Dependency Management:** IDF Component Manager (`idf_component.yml`)

## Key Files
*   **`main/main.c`**: The application entry point (`app_main`). It configures the display, enables the backlight, and launches the LVGL demo (`lv_demo_benchmark()`).
*   **`main/idf_component.yml`**: Declares the dependency on `lvgl/lvgl` version 9.4.0.
*   **`CMakeLists.txt`**: The main project build configuration. Defines the project name (`lvgl_demo_v9`) and includes extra component directories.
*   **`sdkconfig`**: Project configuration file generated by `idf.py menuconfig`.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
*   ESP-IDF environment installed and set up.

### Building
To build the project, use the standard ESP-IDF build command:
```bash
idf.py build
```

### Flashing & Monitoring
To flash the firmware to the device and monitor the serial output:
```bash
idf.py flash monitor
```

### Configuration
To configure project options (including LVGL settings):
```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

### Changing Demos
The specific LVGL demo being run is selected in `main/main.c`. You can uncomment other demos like `lv_demo_music()` or `lv_demo_widgets()` to try them.

## Code Style & Conventions
*   **Indentation:** Standard C indentation (typically 4 spaces).
*   **Locking:** LVGL is not thread-safe by default. The code uses `bsp_display_lock()` and `bsp_display_unlock()` to ensure thread safety when interacting with LVGL APIs.
*   **BSP:** Hardware-specific initialization is abstracted via the Board Support Package (`bsp/esp-bsp.h`).
